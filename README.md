# PINNs_pRES
This repository keeps scripts used in my research to invert for ice rheology given 2D full Stokes equations.
The JAX-based PINNs framework based off https://github.com/YaoGroup/DIFFICE_jax. Since my data is a different structure, I reference their work here rather than branch off the entire repository. The general framework for data processing and the PINN inversion are based off scripts found in DIFFICE_jax.
